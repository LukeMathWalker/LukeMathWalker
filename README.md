### Ciao! ✋

I am a mathematician turned Machine Learning Engineer turned Software Engineer.  
I am an immigrant living in London (UK 🇬🇧), born and raised in Rome (Italy 🇮🇹).

### Writing ✍️ 
- 💬 I blog fairly regularly on [A Learning Journal](https://lpalmieri.com). You can [subscribe to my newsletter](https://www.lpalmieri.com/subscribe/) to be notified when new content is published.
- 📕 I'm the author of [Zero To Production In Rust](https://zero2prod.com), a hands-on introduction to backend development in Rust. You can buy a copy at [zero2prod.com](https://zero2prod.com).

### Speaking 🗣️
I have been speaking at conferences (QCon, RustFest, RustLab, CodeMotion, RustyDays, EuroRust) and meetups.
You can find recordings and slides for all my talks [here](https://www.lpalmieri.com/talks/).

### Work 💸
I am a Senior Engineer at AWS, previously a Principal Engineer at [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com).  

### Open Source 🦀
I am primarily active in the Rust ecosystem.  
My main focus at the moment is [`pavex`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex), a new breed of Rust web framework. You can learn more about it in the [announcement blog post](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/a-taste-of-pavex-rust-web-framework/).

My portfolio of contributions is varied:

- I wrote [Build Your Own JIRA with Rust](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/build-your-own-jira-with-rust/), a hands-on workshop to get started with Rust;
- I am the author of a bunch of Rust crates for various purposes. In particular:
  - [`wiremock-rs`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs), HTTP mocking for black-box testing;
  - [`cargo-chef`](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/fast-rust-docker-builds/), a `cargo` sub-command to leverage caching in Rust Docker builds;
  - [`tracing-bunyan-formatter`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/tracing-bunyan-formatter), a formatting layer for the `tracing` instrumentation framework;
- I spent more than a year contributing to the Rust numerical ecosystem ([`ndarray`](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray), [`ndarray-stats`](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray-stats) and [`linfa`](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/));
